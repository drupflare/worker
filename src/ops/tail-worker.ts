 * Tail Worker: reads the producer's own trace events, including `cpuTime`.
 *
 * A Tail Worker rather than `wrangler tail`. Every absolute CPU figure in TECHNICAL_REPORT.md was
 * read by a human with `wrangler tail` attached, which means the project can only
 * see its own cost while someone is watching. A Tail Worker receives the same trace
 * events from inside the platform, continuously, with no operator present -- so a
 * regression shows up as a log line instead of as a slow page.
 *
 * It also carries the CANARY. The CPU-attribution result the whole slicing design
 * rests on is undocumented behaviour: work parked in one Durable Object invocation
 * and resumed in another is charged to the RESUMING invocation. If Cloudflare
 * changes that, nothing in the product fails loudly -- renders just stop fitting.
 * So the canary re-runs the three-invocation probe and this Worker checks the
 * invariant against the cpuTime it observes, which is the only place the numbers are
 * visible.
 *
 * The pure functions are exported and driven by scripts/test-tail-worker.mjs, so the
 * verdict logic is a gate test rather than something only a deploy can check.
